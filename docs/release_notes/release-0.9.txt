CHIP-SPV 0.9 Released
---------------------

The goal of CHIP-SPV is to make HIP and CUDA applications portable to
devices which support SPIR-V's OpenCL profile as the input intermediate
language. It supports OpenCL and Intel oneAPI Level Zero as the low-level
runtime options.

This is the first preview release of the project, thus please tolerate some
bumps the road. However, we have tested it in the past weeks and shaved off
the most dramatic issues with a bunch of tests and small application cases.

Testers and especially contributing developers are welcomed to join the
effort!

Release Highlights
------------------

* The compilation toolchain works with upstream Clang/LLVM 15.
* Over 600 unit tests and various small applications pass.
* See the Features document for the current HIP/CUDA feature coverage.
* Tested with Intel Level Zero on multiple GPU devices.
* Tested with Intel OpenCL for CPUs and GPUs.
