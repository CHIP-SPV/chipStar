CHIP-SPV 0.9 Released
---------------------

The goal of CHIP-SPV is to make HIP and CUDA applications portable to
devices which support SPIR-V's OpenCL profile as the input intermediate
language. It supports OpenCL and Intel oneAPI Level Zero as the low-level
runtime options.

This is the first preview release of the project, thus bumps the road.
However, we have tested it somewhat and shaved off the most apparent
issues with a bunch of tests and small application cases.

Testers and especially contributing developers are welcomed to join the
effort.

Release Highlights
------------------

* The compilation toolchain works with upstream Clang/LLVM 14 and 15.
* Over 600 unit tests and various small applications pass.
* See the Features document for the current HIP/CUDA feature coverage.
* Tested with Intel Level Zero on multiple GPU devices [list].
* Tested with Intel OpenCL for CPUs and GPUs on various devices [list]
