# CHIP-SPV internals for developers

The code of CHIP-SPV can be divided in two main parts: compilation and runtime library.

## Compilation

Compilation of HIP sources with CHIP-SPV is done by Clang. The Clang compiler since version 14 now has all features to support the CHIP-SPV compilation process. In particular, the Clang driver (the program that "drives" the actual compilation process by running other programs) knows the steps to compile a CHIP-SPV program. The steps are:

1) Compilation of the source in device mode (host code is ignored) to LLVM IR.
2) Linking of the LLVM IR (from previous step) to the CHIP-SPV bitcode library (see 'CHIP-SPV bitcode library' below).
3) Running the necessary transformation passes (see LLVM passes below).
4) Converting the device bitcode to a SPIR-V binary. Currently, the SPIRV-LLVM Translator tool is used for this, but in the future we may switch to using LLVMâ€™s SPIR-V backend as it becomes stable.
5) Bundling the SPIR-V in clang's "offload bundle" fat binary format (in theory multiple binary formats could be bundled here, but currently CHIP-SPV only includes the SPIR-V binary).
6) Compilation of the source in the host mode (device code is ignored in this step) to LLVM IR. The offload bundle binary is included in the compilation unit as a "magic" global variable.
7) Assembling & linking of the LLVM IR from previous step to produce final object.

These steps with the exact arguments can be seen if Clang is run with the "-v" argument. Additionally, if "--save-temps" argument is used, Clang will also keep the temporary output files of the compilation steps. These are useful for debugging the process. For example, let's say we want to debug LLVM passes on the `samples/hipmath` example. Running `make VERBOSE=1` gives us the command line CMake uses to compile the example:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/clang++ -DLLVMHipPasses_EXPORTS -I/usr/lib/llvm-14/include -Wall .... -D__HIP_PLATFORM_SPIRV__= -x hip --target=x86_64-linux-gnu --offload=spirv64 -nohipwrapperinc --hip-path=/path/to/chip/build -std=c++17 -MD -MT samples/hipmath/CMakeFiles/hipmath.dir/hipmath.cc.o -MF CMakeFiles/hipmath.dir/hipmath.cc.o.d -o CMakeFiles/hipmath.dir/hipmath.cc.o -c samples/hipmath/hipmath.cc
```

Running the same command with additional "-v --save-temps" shows this:

```bash

### CHIP-SPV bitcode library

This is a library which contains HIP device-side functions (math, workgroup and others) which either don't exist in OpenCL at all, or have different implementation (different name, function signature etc), and implements these by using OpenCL device-side functions (or OpenCL extensions where possible).

For example, the `__syncthreads()` call is implemented by calling `barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE)`, `rhypot()` has no equivalent in OpenCL so it's implemented via OCML, and shuffle functions are implemented using cl_khr_subgroup_shuffle and cl_khr_subgroup_shuffle_relative extensions. Kernels that call cross-lane intrinsics that are sensitive to the fixed warp width are handled by annotating them with cl_intel_reqd_sub_group_size.

### CHIP-SPV-specific LLVM passes

There are several transformations (LLVM passes) done on the LLVM IR of the device code to deal with differences between CUDA and OpenCL/Level0/SPIR-V capabilities. The passes can be found in `<CHIP-SPV>/llvm-passes`. Most of them have more documentation in the source. Note that for debugging LLVM passes, it's recommended to compile Clang+LLVM in debug mode and enable assertions (`cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON ...`); the Clang/LLVM packages in linux distributions are usually compiled in release mode, without assertions.

* HipAbort.cpp - special handling for abort() calls from the device side (to cause a host abort currently).
* HipDefrost.cpp - removes freeze from instructions (workaround for the llvm-spirv translator).
* HipDynMem.cpp - replaces dynamically sized shared-memory variables (`extern __shared__ type variable[];`) with a kernel argument. This is because in OpenCL, dynamically-sized local memory can only be passed as kernel argument.
* HipGlobalVariable.cpp - creates special kernels that handle access and modification of global scope variables.
* HipPasses.cpp - defines a pass plugin that runs a collection of LLVM passes (= rest of the files in this directory).
* HipPrintf.cpp - pass to convert calls to the CUDA/HIP printf() to OpenCL/SPIR-V compatible printf() calls.
* HipStripUsedIntrinsics.cpp - pass to remove llvm.used and llvm.compiler.used intrinsic variables.
* HipTextureLowering.cpp - pass that transforms kernels (and texturing functions) with `hipTextureObject_t` argument to kernels with actual opencl image+sampler arguments.
* HipWarps.cpp - pass that handles warp-sensitive kernels

### Support for straight-from-CUDA-sources compilation

Compiling CUDA sources directly (instead of hopping through HIP) is supported by means of a compiler wrapper (in `bin/cuspv`) and some header files. The important header file is `include/cuspv/cuda_runtime.h`. This wraps HIP API functions with static inline versions of their CUDA counterparts, and maps the CUDA API types to HIP API types. Both deprecated and unavailable APIs are marked with an attribute (although not all unavailable APIs are yet present in the header).

In theory, cuda.h should contain the CUDA driver API only, but because HIP uses the same object types for both CUDA driver & runtime API equivalents, there isn't much point in separating them. In CUDA, the difference between cuda_runtime_api.h and cuda_runtime.h is that the former only contains C code, while the latter contains C++. In our headers, all definitions are currently in the same file.

The implementation does not require CUDA headers from Nvidia, but it does require the HIP headers.

## Runtime

The runtime implements the HIP API. It consists mainly of these files:

* `src/CHIPBindings.cc` - implementation of HIP API functions like e.g. `hipEventRecord` by using the abstract backend classes.
* `src/CHIPBackend.{cc,hh}` - a set of abstract backend classes used by the HIP API functions.
* `src/backend/Level0/CHIPBackendLevel0.{cc,hh}` - Level0 implementation of the abstract backend.
* `src/backend/OpenCL/CHIPBackendOpenCL.{cc,hh}` - OpenCL implementation of the abstract backend.
* `src/CHIPDriver.{cc,hh}` - implementation of (un)initialization routines.
* `src/spirv.{cc,hh}` - a very simple SPIR-V binary parser, only enough to parse function names & their arguments.
* `src/logging.{cc,hh}` - spdlog logging library setup.
* `src/hip_conversions.hh` - contains various conversion helpers e.g. converting hipTextureAddressMode to corresponding OpenCL's address mode constants.

### Application lifetime

For every application compiled in HIP mode, Clang inserts several hidden initialization calls which are called before main().
These called functions are implemented in the runtime, `src/CHIPBindings.cc`; the names start with `__hip`:

`__hipRegisterFatBinary`: this is called with the "clang offload bundle" binary blob. The function parses the binary's header and ignores all bundles except the SPIR-V one. The SPIR-V binary is than handed over to the backends for compilation, but it's also parsed by the runtime (with the mini SPIR-V parser) to obtain function signatures and arguments. This is necessary to properly set up arguments for function calls.

`__hipRegisterFunction`: this is called with each kernel name. It connects a function name with a host pointer (void*). That host pointer is later used by launch API.

`__hipRegisterVar`: this registers global variables, again connecting a host pointer with a variable name.

there is an additional `__hipUnregisterFatBinary()` called after main() returns; in CHIP-SPV, this calls `CHIPUninitialize()` once the number of loaded modules becomes zero.


# Release management

For each release, a release manager is assigned. Release manager is responsible
for creating and requesting testers from different platforms. After a release
candidate round with success reports and no failure reports, a release is published.

A checklist of things to do for a release:

* Check that CHANGES has the most interesting updates since last release.
  Add missing notable changes from git log.

* Update the docs/Features.md with any changes.

* Create a single commit in main branch: change the version to the
  release one (without -pre), in all relevant places (CHANGES, docs,
  CMakeLists.txt, etc); update the libCHIP.so version (if required);
  check that supported LLVM versions are correct.
  Create the release branch from this commit and push it to github.

* In the main branch, create a new commit: increase version
  number (with -pre suffix) in all relevant places; update the
  libCHIP.so version; increase the supported LLVM versions in
  cmake/LLVM.cmake. Commit, push main to github. Now development
  can go on in main while the release branch is being stabilized.

* The previous two steps ensure that merge-base of release & main is
  the start of release branch, which means that merging release
  to the main will not screw up the version numbers in the main.
  Bugs should be fixed first in release branch then merged into main,
  but ofc it's also possible to cherry-pick commits.

* Create a new release on Github. Mark it as pre-release. This should
  create both a tarball and a git tag.

* Request for testers in all communication channels. Point the testers to
  send their test reports to you privately or by adding them to the wiki.
  A good way is to create a wiki page for the release schedule and a test
  log. See https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chip-spv/wiki/Release-testing-of-chip-spv-0-9
  for an example.

* To publish a release, create a new release on Github without the
  checking the pre-release checkbox. Notify interested parties.

* update the github pages to point to doxygen documentation of the
  latest release.
