# CHIP-SPV

CHIP-SPV is a HIP implementation that abstracts HIP API, providing a
set of base classes that can be derived from to implement an
additional, SPIR-V capable backend on which to execute HIP
calls.

Currently CHIP-SPV supports OpenCL and Level Zero as backend alternatives.

This project is an integration of [HIPCL](https://github.com/cpc/hipcl) and
[HIPLZ](https://github.com/jz10/anl-gt-gpu/) projects.

## Prerequisites

* Cmake >= 3.18.0
* Clang >= 14.0
* SPIRV-LLVM-Translator from a branch matching to the clang version:
  (e.g. llvm\_release\_140 for Clang 14.0)
  [llvm-spirv](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator)
* For Level Zero Backend
  * [Intel Compute Runtime](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime)
* For OpenCL Backend
  * An OpenCL implementation with (at least partial) 2.x support;
    HIPCL requires Shared Virtual Memory and clCreateProgramWithIL()
    support

## Downloading and Building Clang

Downloading:

```bash
git clone -b release/14.x https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project/llvm/projects
git clone -b llvm_release_140 https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator.git
```

Building:

```bash
cd llvm-project/llvm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;openmp" \ # openmp is optional
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${LLVM_INSTALL_DIR} \
  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host # Also optional, but if "All" is selected, potential issues can arise. Furthermore, speeds up compilation time if limited to just the architectures you actually use.
make
make install
```

## Downloading Sources

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/chip-spv.git
cd chip-spv
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

```bash
# export PATH=${LLVM_INSTALL_DIR}/bin:$PATH
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install location> 
 # optional: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug(default), Release, RelWithDebInfo>

make
make install
```

## Building & Running Unit Tests

```bash
make build_tests_standalone
ctest --timeout 120 # currently some tests might hang
```

## Environment Flags

### CHIP_BE

Select the backend to execute on.
Possible values: opencl(default), level0

### CHIP_LOGLEVEL

Select the verbosity of debug info during execution.
Possible values: trace, debug(default), warn, err, crit

Setting this value to `debug` will print information coming from the CHIP-SPV functions which are shared between the backends.

Settings this value to `trace` will print `debug`, as well as debug infomarmation from the backend implementation itself such as results from low-level Level Zero API calls.

### HIP_PLATFORM

Select which HIP implementation to execute on. Possible values: amd, nvidia, spirv.
If you do not provide this value, `hipcc` will check for existance of the following directions and try to guess which implementation is available:

```bash
/usr/local/cuda
/opt/rocm
```

### Compiling CUDA application directly with CHIP-SPV

Compilation of CUDA sources without changing the sources, can be done in two ways. The first is to replace calls of the nvcc compiler with calls of the wrapper script <CHIP-install-path>/bin/cuspv in Makefiles. The other way is possible when using CMake: use `find_package(HIP REQUIRED CONFIG)` and then use `target_link_libraries(<YOUR_TARGET> hip::CHIP hip::host hip::device)`

## Compiling a HIP application using CHIP-SPV

Compiling a HIP application with CHIP-SPV will allow you to execute HIP code on any device that supports SPIR-V, such as Intel GPUs. To compile a HIP application, all you need to do is to use the `hipcc` compiler wrapper provided by this project. In case you have AMD implementation installed as well, you can switch between them by using `HIP_PLATFORM` environment variable.

You can find various HIP applications here: <https://github.com/CHIP-SPV/hip-testsuite>

```bash
hipcc ./hip_app.cpp -o hip_app
```

## Using CHIP-SPV With CMake

CHIP-SPV provides a `FindHIP.cmake` module so you can verify that HIP is installed:

```bash
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULES_PREFIX <CHIP-SPV install location>/cmake)
find_package(HIP REQUIRED)
```
